   * Create and cache, or get from cache, an Auth instance.

   * to this method will therefore retrieve or create, based on what's appropriate.
   *
   * @param {User} user A user model. This is passed to the Auth object, but also used as a cache key.
   *
   * @return {Auth} An instance of Auth.

  get: (user) ->

    @instances[user._id] or= @create user, => delete @instances[user._id]

  ###*
   * Instantiate an Auth.
   *
   * @param {User} user An instance of User to pass to the Auth constructor.
